/**
 * A basic implementation of [DpadAbstractComposeViewHolder]
 * that forwards [Content] to [composable] and handles clicks.
 *
 * Focus is kept inside the internal [ComposeView] to ensure that it behaves correctly
 * and to workaround the following issues:
 *
 * 1. Focus is not sent correctly from Views to Composables:
 * [b/268248352](https://issuetracker.google.com/issues/268248352)
 * This is solved by just holding the focus in [ComposeView]
 *
 * 2. Clicking on a focused Composable does not trigger the standard audio feedback:
 * [b/268268856](https://issuetracker.google.com/issues/268268856)
 * This is solved by just handling the click on [ComposeView] directly
 *
 * This allows inline definition of ViewHolders in `onCreateViewHolder`:
 *
 * ```kotlin
 * override fun onCreateViewHolder(parent: ViewGroup, viewType: Int): DpadComposeViewHolder<Int> {
 *     return DpadComposeViewHolder(parent) { item, isFocused, isSelected ->
 *          ItemComposable(item, isFocused, isSelected)
 *     }
 * }
 * ```
 * To update the current item, override `onBindViewHolder` and call [setItemState]:
 *
 * ```kotlin
 * override fun onBindViewHolder(holder: DpadComposeViewHolder<Int>, position: Int) {
 *      holder.setItemState(getItem(position))
 * }
 * ```
