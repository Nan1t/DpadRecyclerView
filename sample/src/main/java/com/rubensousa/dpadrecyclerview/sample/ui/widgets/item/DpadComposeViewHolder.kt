/**
 * Currently open issues on official issue tracker:
 * 1. Focus is not sent correctly from Views to Composables: https://issuetracker.google.com/issues/268248352
 * 2. Clicking on a focused Composable does not trigger the standard audio feedback: https://issuetracker.google.com/issues/268268856
 *
 * - Issue 1 is solved by keeping the focus on [composeView] instead of passing it down to composables
 *
 * - Issue 2 is solved by handling the click on [composeView] instead of doing it inside the composables
