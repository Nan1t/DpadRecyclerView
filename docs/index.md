# DpadRecyclerView

A RecyclerView built for Android TV as a replacement for Leanback's BaseGridView.

Proceed to [Getting started](getting_started.md) to start adding `DpadRecyclerView`
to your application.

Motivation for this library is available in my [blog](https://rubensousa.com/2022/11/08/dpadrecyclerview/) in case you're interested.

## Requirements

- minSDK: 21
- Java 8

## New Features compared to Leanback's `BaseGridView`

### Layout

- Grids with different span sizes
- Reverse layout
- XML attributes for easier configuration

### Scrolling and focus

- Changing the alignment configuration smoothly
- Limiting the number of pending alignments
- Non smooth scroll changes
- Continuous and circular grid focus

## Features missing from Leanback's `BaseGridView`

- Scrolling in secondary direction
- Disabling recycling of children
- Saving and restoring children states: clients can save and restore children on the appropriate RecyclerView.Adapter callbacks
- `setChildrenVisibility`: clients can do this by iterating over the children
