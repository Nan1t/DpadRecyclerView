// Recommended: To use Compose together with DpadRecyclerView
implementation "com.rubensousa.dpadrecyclerview:dpadrecyclerview-compose:$latestVersion"

// Optional: Espresso test helpers for your instrumented tests:
androidTestImplementation "com.rubensousa.dpadrecyclerview:dpadrecyclerview-testing:$latestVersion"
```

Documentation: https://rubensousa.github.io/DpadRecyclerView/compose/

```kotlin
class ComposeItemAdapter(
    private val onItemClick: (Int) -> Unit
) : ListAdapter<Int, DpadComposeFocusViewHolder<Int>>(Item.DIFF_CALLBACK) {

    override fun onCreateViewHolder(
        parent: ViewGroup,
        viewType: Int
    ): DpadComposeFocusViewHolder<Int> {
        return DpadComposeFocusViewHolder(parent) { item ->
            ItemComposable(
                item = item,
                onClick = {
                    onItemClick(item)
                }
            )
        }
    }

    override fun onBindViewHolder(
        holder: DpadComposeFocusViewHolder<Int>, 
        position: Int
    ) {
        holder.setItemState(getItem(position))
    }
    
}
```
